# dinky_dungeon
Dinky Dungeon is a small text-based fantasy adventure written in Python.  I wrote Dinky Dungeon to continue to learn new things about Python and to apply these concepts.  Dinky Dungeon would be great for someone who is brand new to Python to learn from and is generic enough for anyone to take and make their own. Here are some features I'm particularly happy that I got to work:

1.  Putting monster stats in dictionary allows for easy expansion and addition of new monsters. 
2.  Skill checks based on defined difficulty vs. hero stats + a die roll (just like the D20 rule system) 
3.  x, y coordinate navigation system.  This is still a little wonky, but it allows for the creation of an actual dungeon you can     walk around in.

There are three files that make Dinky Dungeon work:
main.py - This is the main file.  Run this file from command line to launch the game. 
variables.py - This file initalizes and defines all the global variables used by the game.
dinky_dungeon.py - This file contains all the functions that make up the game.

I'm just beginning to learn about Python and certainly welcome any feedback you might have.  Please shoot any suggestions or comments you might have to davidawilson77@gmail.com
