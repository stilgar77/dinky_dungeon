# dinky_dungeon
Dinky Dungeon is a small text-based fantasy adventure written in Python.  I wrote Dinky Dungeon to continue learning about Python and to apply some of these concepts.  Here are some features I'm particularly happy that I got to work:

1.  Putting monster stats in dictionary allows for easy expansion and addition of new monsters. 
2.  Skill checks based on defined difficulty vs. hero stats + a die roll (just like the D20 rule system) 
3.  x, y coordinate navigation system.  This is still a little wonky, but it allows for the creation of an actual dungeon you can     walk around in.

I'm just beginning to learn about Python and certainly welcome any feedback you might have.  Please shoot any suggestions or comments you might have to davidawilson77@gmail.com
